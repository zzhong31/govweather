# simpleweather
React Hooks frontend Weather app w/ Express backend. Weather data from the weather.gov API, search powered by google maps places

The primary purpose of this weather app is simplicity. Ideally, one would be able to get all the revelant information from just scanning the front page while the search is included for the ocassional lookup of a different location. The amount of weather info is limited, since most of the time someone is really only interested in how hot it is and if it will rain or not.
